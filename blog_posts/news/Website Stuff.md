# The Ability Experience
### Mission
We use shared experiences to support people with disabilities and develop the men of Pi Kappa Phi into servant leaders.

### Vision
Create a community, one relationship at a time, where the abilities of all people are recognized and valued.

### Values
Abilities, Teamwork, Empathy and Integrity

### What We Do
Over the course of The Ability Experience’s history, the way the organization achieves its mission has changed often without ever forgetting its roots. When it was founded, The Ability Experience was based on the construction of play units for children with disabilities. It was only a matter of years before construction was no longer the sole focal point of the organization.
Cycling was introduced 10 years into the organization’s history with Journey of Hope, a cross-country cycling event, followed by Gear Up Florida, a similar event across the state. With the addition of Build America a few years later, cycling and construction truly began working hand-in-hand to change the lives of people with disabilities.

Currently, The Ability Experience still utilizes construction and cycling as main vehicles for impact, but has also added The Ability Experience Challenges, events not restricted to only members of Pi Kappa Phi focused on pushing the limits of human ability.

More than any one event, though, is the idea of service leadership. The goal of each and every Ability Experience program is to give of one’s self in order to benefit people with disabilities, instilling a lifelong commitment to service.

# About
## History
The house was built in the late 19th century, with construction finishing in 1896, at a cost of about 500,000 dollars. It was owned by John W. Paine, a wealthy local businessman. At the time it was built, the house was heralded as the most extravagant residence in Troy.
The structure of the house is on a plot of land that had previously been the location of the Paine homestead, and was supposedly modeled after a house in which Mr. Paine had lived in outside of Washington, D.C. Each of the rooms was designed to mimic rooms in other houses that Mr. Paine had seen in his travels around the world. You will notice the striking change in decor as you walk between rooms.

John Paine’s son, who inherited the house after the passing of his father, had no heirs to leave the house to upon his death. The house was handed to his butler, who then handed it to his daughter. His daughter gave the house to Russell Sage College and the mansion was used as an alumni house. Etiquette classes were held in the dining room. Since then, much of the house has been updated to modern standards.

Unfortunately, it has also sustained considerable damage. Since our acquisition of the house, we have strove to restore both its historic look and ability to be used as a modern home for the brothers living here.

The Alpha Tau Chapter of Pi Kappa Phi was originally located on the corner of First Street and what is now Congress Street, in the middle of Russell Sage property. In 1950, as part of an effort to consolidate their campus, the College offered to exchange the Paine Mansion for the fraternity house, plus $10,000. Since 1951, the brothers of Pi Kappa Phi have lived in and cared for The Castle.

## Present Day
Every bedroom contains lofts in order to maximize living space. No room is modified in order to maintain the original structure of the house, although we do perform repairs which are sometimes necessary due to water damage or just simple aging. A major repair accomplished by the brothers was the Parlor ceiling. About a quarter of the ceiling fell in the early 1980’s due to water damage from a burst pipe. The fresco was damaged, as well as much of the plaster molding that goes around the ceiling. A talented alumnus from 1957 restored the painting, and our then chapter adviser, who was also a skilled craftsman, helped brothers recreate the molding pattern and restore the ceiling.
The brothers who live in this house lead a self-sustained lifestyle. Each night, one brother will cook dinner for the whole house, and four brothers are responsible for cleaning up. One hour every Sunday morning is designated for “work party,” during which all of brothers perform general cleaning, such as sweeping, mopping, and cleaning the bathrooms. At the end of every semester, each brother takes part in larger maintenance and restoration projects.

# Tour of the House
Welcome to the Castle, home to the Alpha Tau chapter of Pi Kappa Phi at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The Castle, as we call it, is currently on the Troy Historic Society register of historic buildings. Our house has also been featured in the movie “The Age Of Innocence”, directed by M. Scorsese.

## The Foyer
This is the greeting place of John Paine, the original owner of the Castle. Covered completely from floor to ceiling with custom wooden panels, the foyer provides an incredibly powerful entry into the house. The foyer features the first of seventeen fireplaces throughout the house, which is surrounded by two stained glass windows. On the mantel rests a wooden ship, one of the antiques pieces placed throughout the house. On the opposite side of the foyer, immense sliding wood doors allow access to each of the other rooms on the first floor, the Parlor, Morrish Room, and Dining Room. A stairway with intricately carved panels guides visitors to the upper floors. On one of panels is a wooden carving of the Paine family tree, justly proclaiming “Toujours Paine,” or in English “Forever Paine.” Just to the right of the entryway into the Parlor is a working grandfather clock, presented to our house by the national office of Pi Kappa Phi. The foyer is finished with a beautiful parquet floor which was recently restored in 2003 with generous help from our alumni.

## The Parlor
Above on the left is the view of the Parlor from the Foyer. Here you see another fireplace. On both sides are coves for candles or other decorations. The door curtains are not the original curtains – they were in fact donated by the production team for “The Age of Innocence”. Before they began filming they renovated much of the first floor. This involved replacing the curtains, putting new wallpaper (actually a decorated cloth), and numerous other things that we will talk about.

Above on the right is a view of the Parlor from the Smoking Room. As one can see, this room is designed in the classical English style.

The window provides a great view of downtown Troy. Currently we use this as our meeting room. Following the restoration of the floors, the Alpha Tau Foundation has generously donated new couches to the house. On the ceiling in this room is a giant canvas, which has been stretched across the ceiling. Renovations to the ceiling involved taking the canvas down and touching up the color and re-stretching it across the ceiling.

## Dining Room
This area was once used as John Paine’s Dining Room. Seen at the top of the second picture is the DJ booth, where a string quartet originally played for Paine during dinner. To the left and right of the fireplace are alcoves, each circular with a bench around the outside wall. The fireplace also has two benches on the left and right side. The right side alcove has a door that leads to the rear “servant” staircase. These stairs lead from the kitchen to the third floor and are secluded from the rest of the house. It was used by the servants and butler to travel between floors without being seen by Paine or his guests. Along the left side of the room you can see another bookcase that has been built into the wall of the house. Above it is one of the many stained glass windows. This particular window has John Paine’s initials in it.

This picture shows more of the Italian marble used to make this Italian style room quite authentic. The trim above the marble is painted in gold leaf paint, as is much of the ceiling in this room. Built into the right side of the room is a trophy case. A door the the right adjoins to a servant room. This room was used to bring food to the dining room. There is a dumb waiter, a sink and storage for dishes and a closet to store chairs and the leaves to the extending table seen in the Parlor. There is a mechanical bell located in the center of the floor, that can be rung by Paine from the Dining room to bring a servant out.
